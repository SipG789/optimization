    refactoring code 

In this first challenge I have been given a starter code and I am going to refactor it to meet accepted criteria. 

Horiseon-description

This website is intended to be a homepage for 'Horiseon,' in this website the user can view links such as 'Search Engine Optimization;' 'Online Reputation Management;' & 'Social Media Marketing.'
The website is intended to be informative.

As I looked throught the HTML, I noticed some links were not working, so I made sure to fix them and add the proper id's in order for the link to work. 
There was a lot of semantic HTML that needed to be included. While this didn't really change the layout much visually, it will help screen readers understand and access the website.

I also added 'section' elements to the div's to clean it up a bit and let the browser know to group these together with proper semantics. 

The visual provided did not include a footer, however there was a footer included in the hypertext, so I removed it. 

CSS:

After working witht the HTML I moved over to the css sheet. 
These changes were not much but once again I had to ensure that I met criteria listed. 
I increased the font size of the header in order to match the visual. 

I added a widht and line height to the 'p' element. This made the text look closer to the visual. 

The hero image was cut off so I increased the height in order to see the full image. 

The class 'benefits' needed to be a bit longer so I added more height and a margin bottom so that it could match the mock up provided. 

I also went ahead and removed the css rules for the footer, given that the footer was removed.
